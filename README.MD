#### 1. What IS CraftLib?
CraftLib is a simple Kotlin library which aims to *completely recreate* many of
the essential concepts of Minecraft.
This includes **protocol, NBT, chat, localization** and more to come!

#### 2. Using it.
To include CraftLib into your project, add the Maven Central repository to your project.
Then add the appropriate dependency notation for your build system to include our package.

    <artifactId>craftlib-protocol</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```
